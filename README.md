  ##  Repository with some Pentest tools | Recognition phase | shell script 
  
  ## The only demand will be to copy the lists that are used in the scripts to the main directory of the scripts
  
  ## All are functional, but improvements are being made, such as: 
  
  #### -Best and more organized outputs in the scripts
  
  #### -Better performance
  
  #### -Help Menus, scripts design chances (make them prettier)
  
  #### -I'm working on it as I progress in my studies 
  
  
  
  ### ANY HELP WITH THE CODES I WOULD BE VERY THANKFULL!
